# Data-Mining
Some things I have done as part of a Data Mining course at American University.

Description of each file:

Ross Bollinger Assignment 1.docx: This is the first assignment I completed in my Data Mining course. It was an assignment testing MLPs and
the J48 algorithm on discrete and continuous data sets. I used a data mining program called WEKA to test the algorithms and I got the
datasets being tested from an official site recommended by the professor. 

Ross Bollinger Assignment 2.docx: This is the second assignment I completed in my Data Mining course. The objective was to find the best
learning algorithm for use with two data sets related to app data. I chose a set of algorithms to test and used a visualization data mining
software called Orange.

Ross Bollinger Final Project Report.docx: This is the final project I completed in my Data Mining course. My goal with this project was to
test a newer natural language processing model, Word2Vec, against an older one, Bag of Words, on text from English Renaissance plays. I
created the datasets myself and formatted them manually. I have not included them in this repository due to how may there are.
All details are in the write-up.
